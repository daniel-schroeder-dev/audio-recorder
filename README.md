# Audio Recorder

This is a simple web app to record and download audio written for the kids at CWHQ to use in their projects.

## Usage

Make sure to allow audio on the webpage, select your preferred input device, and hit "Record" to begin recording. Press "Stop" to stop recording and you'll be prompted to save the file locally. 

The app is running at [https://daniel-schroeder-dev.github.io/audio-recorder/](https://daniel-schroeder-dev.github.io/audio-recorder/) if you want to try it out!
